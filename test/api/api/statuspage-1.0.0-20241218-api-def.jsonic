All calls\ncurrently begin with the following prefix:\n\n  https://api.statuspage.io/v1/\n\n## RESTful Interface\nWherever possible, the API seeks to implement repeatable patterns with logical,\nrepresentative URLs and descriptive HTTP verbs. Below are some examples and conventions\nyou will see throughout the documentation.\n\n* Collections are buckets: https://api.statuspage.io/v1/pages/asdf123/incidents.json\n* Elements have unique IDs: https://api.statuspage.io/v1/pages/asdf123/incidents/jklm456.json\n* GET will retrieve information about a collection/element\n* POST will create an element in a collection\n* PATCH will update a single element\n* PUT will replace a single element in a collection (rarely used)\n* DELETE will destroy a single element\n\n## Sending Data\nInformation can be sent in the body as form urlencoded or JSON, but make sure the\nContent-Type header matches the body structure or the server gremlins will be angry.\n\nAll examples are provided in JSON format, however they can easily be converted to form encoding\nif required.  Some examples of how to convert things are below:\n\n    // JSON\n    {\n      \"incident\": {\n        \"name\": \"test incident\",\n        \"components\": [\"8kbf7d35c070\", \"vtnh60py4yd7\"]\n      }\n    }\n\n    // Form Encoded (using curl as an example):\n    curl -X POST https://api.statuspage.io/v1/example \\\n      -d \"incident[name]=test incident\" \\\n      -d \"incident[components][]=8kbf7d35c070\" \\\n      -d \"incident[components][]=vtnh60py4yd7\"\n\n# Authentication\n\n<!-- ReDoc-Inject: <security-definitions> -->",
